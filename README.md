# Cache-MemoryBlock
Contains script to generate memory block/cache based on positional encoding

it takes only **two transistor swithes delay**(for 12 bit row/column selection), and about **14 transistors switches** for 12 bit address decode.
Totally it has about 2176 transistors.

For **180nm** (osu018) selector delay is about **0,3 ns**. 

**TODO:** Make balanced tree version.

Read about SSD, DDR, HBM.

Make InMemoryComputing ) (with reading 8 bit values from eeprom or so).

Calculate metrics with respect to FO4-FO(N).

Add more int to script in repository.
