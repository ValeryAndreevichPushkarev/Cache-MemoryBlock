# Cache-MemoryBlock
Contains script to generate memory block/cache based on positional encoding

it takes only **two transistor swithes delay**(for 12 bit row/column selection), and about **14 transistors switches** for 12 bit address decode.
Totally it has about 2176 transistors.

For **150nm** (osu150) selector delay is about **0,3 ns**. 

**TODO:** Make balanced tree version.
Read about SSD, DDR, HBM.
Add more int to script in repository.
