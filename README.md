# Cache-MemoryBlock
Contains script to generate memory block/cache based on positional encoding

it takes only **two transistor swithes delay**(for 12 bit row/column selection), and about 7 transistors switches for 12 bit address decode

Its allows to create DRAM arrays with 2-4 Ghz freq and dramatically small timings.

**TODO:** Add script to generate 1 kb/1mb/1gb modules
